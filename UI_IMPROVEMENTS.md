Done! I have overhauled the UI for both Trainee and Trainer interfaces, focusing on mobile responsiveness, consistent theming, and better typography.

Key improvements:
1.  **Typography**: Added `Heebo` font for modern, readable Hebrew text.
2.  **Theme**: Unified colors using CSS variables. Dark mode is now consistent deep blue/slate (`#0a1628`) with Green (`#00ff88`) accents.
3.  **Mobile UI**:
    -   Added "Safe Area" padding for modern phones (iPhone X+).
    -   Increased touch targets for buttons and inputs (especially in Workout Logger).
    -   Improved Bottom Navigation Bar.
    -   Added a smooth Mobile Sidebar for Trainers.
4.  **Components**:
    -   **Inputs**: Larger, clearer, with better focus states.
    -   **Cards**: Consistent shadows and borders.
    -   **Charts**: Styled to match the theme.
    -   **Sliders**: Custom styled RIR slider.

The app should now feel much more native and polished on mobile devices.
